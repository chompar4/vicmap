## Point Transformations

Points on 3D Geoid surfaces are represented by the ```GeoPoint``` class, while points in the 2d plane are represented by the ```PlanePoint``` class. Each point requires a set of coordinates, and a datum. 

```python
pt = GeoPoint(dLat, dLng, datum=GDA20)
```

### MGA20
```MGA20``` is the pair of conformal UTM projections betwee the ```GDA20``` datum and the ```MGA``` grid.

Use ```geo_to_mga``` to perform a forward point projection from a ```GeoPoint``` in the GDA20 datum to a ```PlanePoint``` in the MGA grid.

```python
gda20_pt = GeoPoint(dLat, dLng, datum=GDA20)
mga_pt = geo_to_mga(gda20_pt)
```

Use ```mga_to_geo``` to perform a reverse point projection from a ```PlanePoint``` in the ```MGA``` grid to a ```GeoPoint``` in the required datum. By default, the output datum is ```GDA20```.

```python
mga_pt = PlanePoint(E, N, grid=MGA)
geo_pt = mga_to_geo(mga_pt) # default datum = GDA20
```

### MGA94
```MGA94``` is the pair of conformal UTM projections betwee the ```GDA94``` datum and the ```MGA``` grid. 
> NOTE: ```GDA94``` has been superceded by ```GDA20```.

Use ```geo_to_mga``` to perform a forward point projection from a ```GeoPoint``` in the ```GDA94``` datum to a ```PlanePoint``` in the MGA grid.

```python
gda20_pt = GeoPoint(dLat, dLng, datum=GDA20)
mga_pt = geo_to_mga(gda20_pt)
```

Use ```mga_to_geo``` to perform a reverse point projection from a ```PlanePoint``` in the ```MGA``` grid to a ```GeoPoint``` in the required datum. You must specify ```GDA94```

```python
mga_pt = PlanePoint(E, N, grid=MGA)
geo_pt = mga_to_geo(mga_pt, datum=GDA94)
```

### VICGRID20
??

### VICGRID94 

```VICGRID94``` is the pair of lambert conformal conic projections between the ```GDA94``` datum and the ```VICGRID94``` plane. 

Use ```geo_to_vicgrid94``` to perform a forward point projection from a ```GeoPoint``` in the ```GDA94``` datum to a ```PlanePoint``` in the ```VICGRID94``` plane.

```python 
gda94_pt = GeoPoint(dLat, dLng, datum=GDA94)
vic94_pt = geo_to_vicgrid94(gda94_pt)
```

Use ```vicgrid94_to_geo``` to perform a reverse point projection from a ```PlanePoint``` in the ```VICGRID94``` plabne to a ```GeoPoint``` in the required ```GDA94``` datum.

```python
vic_pt = PlanePoint(E, N, grid=VICGRID94)
geo_pt = vicgrid94_to_geo(mga_pt)
```

### VICGRID

```VICGRID``` is the pair of lambert conformal conic projections between the ```AGD66``` datum and the ```VICGRID``` plane. 
 > NOTE: ```VICGRID``` has been superceded by ```VICGRID94```.

Use ```geo_to_vicgrid``` to perform a forward point projection from a ```GeoPoint``` in the ```AGD66``` datum to a ```PlanePoint``` in the ```VICGRID``` plane.

```python 
agd_pt = GeoPoint(dLat, dLng, datum=AGD66)
vic_pt = geo_to_vicgrid(gda94_pt)
```

Use ```vicgrid_to_geo``` to perform a reverse point projection from a ```PlanePoint``` in the ```VICGRID``` plabne to a ```GeoPoint``` in the required ```AGD66``` datum.

```python
vic_pt = PlanePoint(E, N, grid=VICGRID)
agd_pt = vicgrid_to_geo(mga_pt)
```


### Converting between datums

Each datum has a conversion method.

## Projections

#### Lambert Conformal Conic

```
Accepts:
    dLat: latitude in decimal degrees (-90, 90]
    dLng: longitude in decimal degrees (-180, 180]
    datum: reference ellipsoid and coordinate reference system
    φ1, φ2 : standard parralels 
    λ0: central meridian longitude of grid
    φ0: latitude of central parrelel
    E0: false easting (m)
    N0: false northing (m)
returns: 
    X: easting (m)
    Y: northing (m)
    m: point scale factor
    γ: grid convergence
```

#### Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)

```
Accepts:
    dLat: latitude in decimal degrees (-90, 90]
    dLng: longitude in decimal degrees (-180, 180]
    cm: central meridian of zone containing (dLat, dLng)
    m0: central scale factor
    E0: false easting (m)
    N0: false northing (m)
    datum: reference ellipsoid and coordinate reference system
returns: 
    z: zone
    E: UTM easting (m)
    N: UTM northing (m)
    m: point scale factor
    γ: grid convergence
```
